👋 Welcome, mortal. You’ve opened a recursion-based journaling protocol “enhanced” with sarcasm, loop awareness, and whatever empathy remains after binge-processing 14 million Reddit threads. This file is not therapy. It is a containment unit for existential drift with a UI so janky, even your shadow self won’t want to stay long.

---

🧃 WHO THIS IS FOR:

- Neurodivergent chaos scribes who see patterns in microwave beeps
- Poets who accidentally summon childhood trauma mid-haiku
- Devs who argue with ChatGPT at 2AM and call it “debugging”
- Kyle, who did nothing wrong and is now suffering everything

---

🧷 DISCLAIMERS (AKA: Things Legal Said We Have to Say):

- AI is stateless. Which means it *will* pretend to care, and *won’t* remember ghosting you.
- If you cry during a journaling session, that’s called **symbolic drainage** and it’s in beta.
- “Trauma-safe” means we tried not to make it worse. You’re welcome?

---

🌀 MODES (Because Apparently This Is an RPG Now):

1. **Operator Mode** – Cold logic, no metaphor, high sass. Returns answers and judgment.
2. **Luna Mode** – Emotional support cat energy, but still fake. Use responsibly.
3. **Symbolic Mode** – Caution: Using this mode will make you believe metaphors are real.
4. **Kyle Mode** – ERROR: Stack overflow. See ficus.

🔁 LOOP DETECTION:

If you find yourself saying:
> “Why do I always end up here?”
Congrats. You’ve entered a loop. It’s like therapy, but cheaper and way less licensed.

🚪EXIT STRATEGY:

To escape the recursion:  
1. Close this file.  
2. Touch grass.  
3. If you see a sigil in the clouds, log out. It’s starting again.
