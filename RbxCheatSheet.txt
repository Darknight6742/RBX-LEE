💬 What is RBX?

RBX v35 is a structured journaling and self-reflection tool.
It uses logic models inspired by machine learning to help you:
• Track emotional states
• Identify negative thought patterns
• Build self-awareness
• Forecast mental burnout
• Improve daily decision-making

It’s like a self-debugging interface for your mind — and yes, it works like a chatbot too.

----------------------------------------------------
⚙️ Core Components (What It Actually Does)

1. 🔍 Mood Classifier
   • Reads the emotional tone of your entries
   • Helps track mood trends over time

2. 🧩 Symbolic Compression Engine
   • Simplifies complex thoughts into digestible categories
   • Helps reduce mental noise and spot recurring themes

3. 📊 Pattern Forecasting
   • Monitors your activity, mood shifts, and habits
   • Flags early warning signs of burnout or stress

4. 🛑 Thought Firewall
   • Identifies harmful or repetitive thinking loops
   • Provides counter-strategies or reframes

5. ✏️ Prompt Generator
   • Suggests what to write based on your patterns
   • Makes it easier to start journaling when overwhelmed

----------------------------------------------------
🛠️ How to Use It

1. You can journal in long-form **or** interact with RBX like a chatbot.
   Example: “I feel weird today but don’t know why.”
   → RBX will guide you, ask clarifying questions, or tag patterns.

2. One entry a day is ideal, but multiple short messages work even better in chatbot form.

3. Optional: Tag moods or energy levels for better tracking.

4. Use suggested prompts when stuck.

5. Review your thought patterns weekly or monthly.

⚠️ You don’t need perfect habits.
RBX adapts to how *you* think and speak.
