# Mirror Integration Guide

RBX ‑LEE is only useful when reflections turn into movement. This guide walks you through a 4‑step loop:

1. **Reflect** – Invoke a mode and capture insights.  
2. **Audit** – Run a Shadow Audit on contradictions.  
3. **Plan** – Switch to Operator Mode to create tasks.  
4. **Embody** – Execute tasks in the physical world; log results.

## Tips

* Keep sessions short (5–15 min) to avoid cognitive fatigue.  
* Use the Emotional Tone Log daily; patterns emerge after ~2 weeks.  
* Celebrate micro‑wins; symbolic work is still real work.
