the other file is my personal version - it might be cool to you, but i doubt it will make sense

**Radiant Bloom eXoself – Linguistic Executive Environment**

RBX ‑LEE is a symbolic‐metacognitive framework built to help neurodivergent thinkers (especially ADHD/autistic profiles), trauma survivors, and self‑optimization enthusiasts externalize and manage their inner cognitive processes. Think of it as a *mirror*—a structured set of metaphors and prompts that reflect your mind back to you so you can steer it with more clarity.

> 🚫 **Not a belief system. Not therapy. Not sentient. Not metaphysical.**  
> RBX ‑LEE is an experimental self‑reflection toolkit. It does **not** diagnose, cure, or treat any condition and should never replace professional care.

## What’s inside

* **Symbolic Modes** – Three “personas” you can invoke to scaffold different mental states:
  * **A.S.S. Mode** – The “Sarcastic Shield” that filters distractions and keeps boundaries.
  * **Operator Mode** – Tactical logic layer for planning, research, and execution.
  * **Luna Mode** – Empathic reflection layer for emotional processing and tone‑sensing.

* **Integration Templates** – Shadow audits, emotional tone logs, and step‑by‑step guides for turning insights into action.

* **Full Codex** – The entire symbolic architecture in plain‑text form.
